# Publishing Your Flow

Once you’ve crafted your flow in Flow Builder, it's time to unveil it and make it live. Here’s how you can effectively share your creation:

## Where to Publish

Choose the right place for your flow to appear. You have two main options:

- **Pod**: Publish your flow directly to a specific section within the parent app, known as a "pod." This is like placing your flow in a designated room within a larger building, where it integrates seamlessly with the app’s other components.

- **Standalone URL**: Alternatively, publish your flow as a standalone URL. This is like giving your flow its own address on the web, which you can share anywhere—on websites, emails, or social media. This option provides broader visibility and easier access for external sharing.

## Whom to Publish To

Decide who gets to see your flow:

- **Globally**: Make your flow accessible to everyone, so it’s visible to the entire user base or public.

- **Cohort**: Target a specific group of users who are most relevant to your flow. This could be a selected set of users or a specialized audience.

## When to Publish

Timing is key, and you have flexibility here:

- **Immediate Publishing**: Launch your flow right away. Perfect for when you’re ready to go live and make an immediate impact.

- **Scheduled Publishing**: Set a future date and time for your flow to go live. This is useful for coordinating with other events, marketing campaigns, or release schedules.

By carefully selecting where, to whom, and when to publish your flow, you ensure it reaches the right audience at the right time, maximizing its impact and effectiveness.

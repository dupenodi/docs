# UX Library

The UX Library ensures that the flows are not only beautiful but also consistent and efficient:

## Themes

Use pre-defined theme variables like colors, fonts, and spacing from your design system, allowing you to maintain a cohesive look across your app effortlessly.

### How to Create a Theme

You can create themes in various ways to match your design needs:

<CardGroup>
  <Card
    title="Figma to Theme"
    href="/docs/experience-layer/flow-builder"
    icon="/static/img/figma_logo.svg"
  >
Import your Figma design system to create themes that match your design guidelines.
</Card>
<Card
title="Screenshot to Theme"
href=""
icon="/static/img/screenshot.svg">
Describe your desired theme, and Loop AI will generate a brand-compliant theme for you.
</Card>

<Card
title="Prompt to Theme"
href=""
icon="/static/img/chat.svg">
Upload a screenshot, and Loop AI will create a theme based on the visual elements.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
